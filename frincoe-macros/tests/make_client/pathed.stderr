error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `t`
  --> tests/make_client/pathed.rs:22:5
   |
20 |     let t = Target {};
   |         - move occurs because `t` has type `Target`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
21 |     t.f1(1);
   |       ----- `t` moved due to this method call
22 |     t.f2(123);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `t`

error[E0596]: cannot borrow `t` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
  --> tests/make_client/pathed.rs:23:5
   |
20 |     let t = Target {};
   |         - help: consider changing this to be mutable: `mut t`
...
23 |     t.f3(1.0, 1.0);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
